<p>Please note that there is no initial release yet. Be careful if you use the 
current development version as there are certain to be errors. If you are interested
in using this package, feel free to add any comments and requests to the tickets.</p>

<p>Oh, and if you know of another package that already has this functionality, please 
let me know. I started building because I could not find one and have no interest
in re-inventing wheels.</p>

<p>Concept hierarchies are common in many knowledge areas and applications of
statistics. They can be deceptively simple, as they are easy to intuit, but can
offer annoying problems while working with them as data set. </p>

<p>This package was made with a specific concept hierarchy in mind where the
hierarchy is represented by a table with id, concept-name and parent-id. This
structure that is often found in biological data, in competency data (Human 
Resource Management) and business-inventories. </p>

<p>A typical example could be as follows:</p>

<pre><code>Level1:      A           B           C          D
             |           |           |     
Level2:    AA AB      BA BB BD      CA    
           |                         |
Level3:   AAA                     CAA CAB
                                   |
Level4:                          CABA
</code></pre>

<p>This kind of tree structure can be used for instance on hierarchies such as
tree &gt; Oak &gt; White Oak. Or Technical Skills &gt; Programming &gt; R, or Sales &gt; EMEA &gt; 
Europe &gt; Lithuania. These are also called multilevel classes, or multilevel
features (in Machine Learning applications). </p>

<p>The goal of the package <code>conceptr</code> package is to help you when you need to work
with these kinds of data by allowing you to make the hierarchy corresponding to
the data explicit so that it becomes easier to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Roll-up data into higher order concepts, even if they are implied but not
included in the data set itself. For example, you have White Oaks and
Chihuaha Oaks, but no entry for "Oaks". That higher order concept "Oak" is
implicit in the data set and can be added by summing sub-level concept.</li>
<li>Visualize the hierarchies as a tree using network3D.</li>
<li>Inspect the data to see whether it conforms with the given hierarchy</li>
<li>Visualize data in the hierarchy using ternary diagrams.</li>
</ol>

<h2>
<a id="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h2>

<p>The package is still far from complete, so please be mindful of errors if you
are going to use this. By all means report or fix any issues that you may find.</p>

<p>To install makes sure you have the package <code>devtools</code> installed and run:</p>

<pre><code>devtools::install_github("fvd/conceptr")
</code></pre>

<h2>
<a id="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h2>

<h3>
<a id="data-formats" class="anchor" href="#data-formats" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data formats</h3>

<p>The library is still primitive and not tested for all possible exceptions. You
can help by reporting any issues you find with your data so that the package
can be made more generic.</p>

<p>At the moment a number of conventions are imposed:</p>

<ol>
<li>The <code>hierarchy</code> data frame has three columns with names <code>c("id","name",
"parent_id")</code>
</li>
<li>The column names in the <code>data</code> data frame need to match the names in
<code>hierarachy$name</code> </li>
</ol>

<p>Note that to match the names in the hierarchy and data data frames both the
<code>hierarchy$name</code> column and column names in <code>data</code> will be normalized with
<code>make.names</code>.</p>

<h2>
<a id="features" class="anchor" href="#features" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h2>

<h3>
<a id="aggregate-by-name" class="anchor" href="#aggregate-by-name" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Aggregate by name</h3>

<p>Aggregate all data from all the sub-levels of a concept by summing the
observations. So in the example <code>aggregate_byname(D)</code> returns <code>D</code> and
<code>aggregate_byname(B)</code> returns <code>B+BA+BB+BD</code>. We need to reference the hierarchy
to use so the full example would be:</p>

<pre><code> aggregate_byname(data, hierarchy, "Level1-D")
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>aggregate_byname(data, hierarchy, "Level1-B")
</code></pre>

<p>The full names in the test data base include the levels, so Level1-A, Level2-AA
etc.</p>

<h3>
<a id="ternary-plots" class="anchor" href="#ternary-plots" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Ternary plots</h3>

<p>Make exploratory analysis of the data at different levels easier by plotting by
name. </p>

<pre><code>visualize_ternary(data, hierarchy, c("A", "BA", "CAA"))
</code></pre>

<h3>
<a id="planned" class="anchor" href="#planned" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Planned</h3>

<ul>
<li>Visualize hierarchy (create tree with network3D)</li>
<li>Inspect hierarchy (check the structure of the hierarchy)</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="example-data" class="anchor" href="#example-data" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Example data</h2>

<p>There is a small example data set included that you can compare to your own.
Please note that you preferably use R-style names (no spaces, no non-ascci) for
the column names in the data file. The package will <code>make.normal</code> any names
that it will find.</p>

<p>To load the test data from the inst folder in the package:</p>

<pre><code>data &lt;- read.csv(system.file("data.csv", package="conceptr"))
hierarchy &lt;- read.csv(system.file("concept-hierarchy.csv", package="conceptr"))
</code></pre>
